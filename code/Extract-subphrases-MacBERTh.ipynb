       "  'It is not only from the fragile flower-vases these sweet odours flow; they breathe through leaf and stem, and the whole being of many trees and bushes, from the stately Cum trees of Australia to the sweet Verbena of Chili.',\n",
       "  'Many must have felt the charm of the strange scent of the Boxbush before Oliver Wendell Holmes told us of its ‘ breathing the fragrance of eternity, for this is one of the odours which carry us out of time into the abysses of the unbeginning past.’ The scent of flowers is often cloying, as of the Tuberose, while that of leaves is often delightful and refreshing, as in the green budding Larch, and in the leaves of Balm and Rosemary, while in many cases fragrance is stored in the wood and permeates down through the roots.',\n",
       "  'To but few it is given to see many of these sweet plants in their native lands, but we who love our gardens may enjoy many of them about us, not merely in drawings or descriptions, but the living, breathing things themselves.',\n",
       "  'The Geraniums in the cottage window bring us the spicy  fragrance of the South African hills ; the Lavender bush of the sunny hills of Provence, where it is at home ; the Roses in the garden bring near us the breath of the wild Roses on a thousand hills ; the aromatic pot-herbs of our gardens are a gift of the shore-lands of France and Italy and Greece.',\n",
       "  'The Sweet Bay bush in the farmer’s or cottage garden comes with its story from the streams of Greece, where it seeks moisture in a thirsty land along with the wild Olive and the Arbutus.',\n",
       "  'And this Sweet Bay is the Laurel of the poets, of the first and greatest of all poet and artist nations of the earth — the Laurel sacred to Apollo, and used in many ways in his worship, as we may see on coins, and in many other things that remain to us of the great civilisations of the past .',\n",
       "  '1 The Myrtle, of less fame, was also a sacred plant beloved for its leaves and blossoms, was, like the Laurel, seen near the temples of the race who built their temples as Lilies are built, whose song is deathless, and the fragments of its art Despair to the artist of our time.',\n",
       "  'And so we see how the fragrant bushes our gardens may entwine for us, apart from their gift of fragrance, living  associations and beautiful thoughts for ever famous in human story.',\n",
       "  'It is not only these trees and climbers, loved by all for their odour, we have to think of, but many delicate ones,  1 ‘ What you call advantageous, Solon, is for these men to be crowned in view of all the world, who just before were objects of pity from their wounds : and yet it seems they think themselves happy if in return for all their labours they can get a bunch of Laurel .’ — From the Greek of Lucian.',\n",

       "  '’  What is the lesson these sweet flowers have for us 1 They tell us — if there were no other flowers to tell us — that a  garden should be a living thing; its life not only fair in form and lovely in colour, but in its breath and essence coming from the Divine.',\n",
       "  'They tell us that the very common attempt to conform these fair lives into tile or other patterns, to clip or set them out as so much mere colour of the paper-stainer or carpet-maker, is to degrade them, and make our gardens ugly and ridiculous, from the point of view of nature or true art.',\n",
       "  'And many of these treasures for the open garden have been shut out of our thoughts owing to exclusion of almost everything that did not make showy colour and lend itself to carpet or other crude modes of setting flowers to compete with tiles and like modes of ‘ decoration.’  Of the many considerations that should occur in the making of a beautiful garden to live in, this of fragrant plants and flowers is one of the first.',\n",
       "  'And happily among every class of flowers which adorn our open-air gardens, there are odorous things to be found.',\n",
       "  'Apart from the groups of plants in which all, or nearly all, are sweet, as in Roses and Violets, the annual and biennial flowers of  our gardens, are rich in fragrance, Stocks, Mignonette, Sweet Peas, Sweet Sultan and Wallflowers, Double Rockets, Sweet Scabious, and many others, the odours of which are not always so popular.',\n",
       "  'These, among the most easily raised of plants, are enjoyed by the simplest cottage gardeners.',\n",
       "  'The garden borders bear for us odours as precious as any breath of tropic Orchid : from the Lily of the Valley to the Carnation — this last being perhaps the most grateful odour of all the flowering host in our garden land.',\n",
       "  'Among these borders one meets with things sweeter than words may tell of — Woodruff, Balm, Pinks, Violets, garden Primroses, Polyanthus, day and other Lilies, early Iris, Narcissus, evening Primroses, Mezereon Bush, Wallflower and Pansies, delicate in their sweetness.',\n",
       "  'No one may be richer in delicate fragrance than the wise man who plants hardy shrubs and flowering trees — Magnolia, Thorn, Daphne, Lilac — names each telling of whole families of delightful things.',\n",
       "  'Among shrubs, those without any very strong odour, like the hardy Heaths, are all the more pleasant to many whose memories are often touched  by remembered fragrance of some plant they do not always know.',\n",
       "  'From the same regions where we found the Laurel and the Myrtle we have the Laurustinus, beautiful in all our sea-coast and milder districts, and many other lovely things happy in our climate : one, the Winter Sweet, even pouring out delicious fragrance in mid-winter : Sweet Gale, that grows in any boggy place, Azalea, Allspice, and the delightful little Mayflower that creeps about in the woodland shades in North America.',\n",
       "  'So, though we cannot boast N of Lemon or Orange groves, our climate is kind to many lovely and fragrant shrubs.',\n",
       "  'Even our ugly walls may be sweet gardens with Magnolia, Honeysuckle, Clematis, Sweet Verbena, and the delightful old Jasmine, still clothing many a house in London.',\n",
       "  'Most precious of all, however, are the noble climbing Tea Roses raised in our own time, mostly in France within the past forty years or so.',\n",
       "  'Among the abortions of this century these are a real gain — the loveliest flowers ever raised by man.',\n",
       "  'Noble in form and colour, and scented as delicately as a J une morn in alpine pastures, with these most precious  of garden roses we could cover all the ugly walls in England and Ireland, and Heaven knows there are many in want of a veil.',\n",
       "  'The old Kent and Sussex way of having an orchard near the house was a good one.',\n",
       "  'Planted for use, it was as precious for its beauty, and not only when the spring winds carry the breath of its myriad blossoms of Cherry, Plum, Apple, or Pear.',\n",
       "  'We have the fruit odours too, and the faint scent of Strawberries, and later their leaves, and the Currant leaves.',\n",
       "  'It would be, in many places, charming to plant a pretty  orchard and have the fruit-garden near or alongside — keeping the less pleasant evidence of vegetables in the background.',\n",
       "  'These beautiful orchards, too, are where the early Daffodils  and Snowdrops appear.',\n",
       "  'Then, with Violets and Primroses  on the banks they may be delightfully sheltered from the  north and east by a grove of our native evergreens — Holly  and Yew — these, in their turn, wreathed here and there  with the fragrant autumn Clematis, Honeysuckles, and  Climbing Wild Roses.',\n",
       "  'Of all the things for garden pictures  there are none so good as the lovely groups of hardy trees  forming our hardy fruits, including the Medlar and Quince,  while near might be the Japanese and other handsome Crabs,  which have so much beauty of bloom and also brilliant fruit  in autumn.',\n",
       "  'MONO the many enjoyments this fascinating  world affords, none are more innocent or  enticing than close association with the  beautiful gems that so happily grace our  gardens, where a balmy atmosphere laden  with sweet perfumes and aromatic fragrance, rich and embowering foliage, with rural seclusion, are ever perfect ideas  of earthly felicity —   ‘ In the calm retreat,   Far from the busy haunts of life,   Where Flora trains her lovely offspring up  To captivate and charm.’   In all countries, civilised and savage, in the religious festivals  of all creeds, and on all occasions whether of grief or rejoicing, the scented attractions of flowers and plants possess an  important significance, and Nature seems to have been most  bountiful in her munificence in scattering these odoriferous  treasures throughout our world, to give cheerfulness to the  earth and happiness to its inhabitants.',\n",
       "  'Every rank of people  seem equally to appreciate them as a gratification to the  organs of sight and smell.',\n",
       "  'The refreshing odours prevalent in a garden, where the richest  perfumes shed their aromatic perfections lavishly around, are  the spoils from Nature’s laboratory, that dispense delicious  medicines to sweeten our existence.',\n",
       "  'There are many common flowers to be found growing in  our meadows which diffuse a gentle fragrance most gratifying  to the senses : and, much as we are concerned with the odour  of those flowers and shrubs which are to be met with in our  gardens and greenhouses, the wild forms are a source of the  keenest pleasure to all.'],\n",

       "  'It stands on a height within the walls of Genoa, but aloof from the town: surrounded by beautiful gardens of its own, adorned with statues, vases, fountains, marble basins, terraces, walks of orange trees and lemon trees, groves of roses and camelias.',\n",
       "  'All its apartments are beautiful in their proportions and decorations; but the great hall, some fifty feet in height, with three large windows at the end, overlooking the whole town of Genoa, the harbour, and the neighbouring sea, affords one of the most fascinating and delightful prospects in the world.',\n",
       "  'Any house more cheerful and habitable than the great rooms are, within, it would be difficult to conceive; and certainly nothing more delicious than the scene without, in sunshine or in moonlight, could be imagined.',\n",
       "  'It is more like an enchanted palace in an Eastern story than a grave and sober lodging.',\n",
       "  'How you may wander on, from room to room, and never tire of the wild fancies on the walls and ceilings, as bright in their fresh colouring as if they had been painted yesterday; or how one floor, or even the great hall which opens on eight other rooms, is a spacious promenade; or how there are corridors and bed-chambers above, which we never use and rarely visit, and scarcely know the way through; or how there is a view of a perfectly different character on each of the four sides of the building; matters little.',\n",
       "  'But that prospect from the hall, is like a vision to me.',\n",
       "  'I go back to it, in fancy, as I have done in calm reality a hundred times a-day; and stand there, looking out, with the sweet scents from the garden rising up about me, in a perfect dream of happiness.',\n",
       "  'There lies all Genoa, in beautiful confusion, with its many churches, monasteries, and convents, pointing up into the sunny sky; and down below me, just where the roofs begin, a solitary convent parapet, fashioned like a gallery, with an iron cross at the end, where sometimes, early in the morning, I have seen a little group of dark-veiled nuns gliding sorrowfully to and fro, and stopping now and then to peep down upon the waking world in which they have no part.',\n",
       "  'Old Monte Faccio, brightest of hills in good weather, but sulkiest when storms are coming on, is here, upon the left.',\n",
       "  'The Fort within the walls (the good King built it to command the town, and beat the houses of the Genoese about their ears, in case they should be discontented) commands that height upon the right.',\n",
       "  'The broad sea lies beyond, in front there; and that line of coast, beginning by the light-house, and tapering away, a mere speck in the rosy distance, is the beautiful coast road that leads to Nice.',\n",
       "  'The garden near at hand, among the roofs and houses: all red with roses and fresh with little fountains: is the Acqua Sola—a public promenade, where the military band plays gaily, and the white veils cluster thick, and the Genoese nobility ride round, and round, and round, in state-clothes and coaches at least, if not in absolute wisdom.',\n",
       "  \"Within a stone ' s-throw, as it seems, the audience of the Day-Theatre sit: their faces turned this way.\",\n",
       "  'But as the stage is hidden, it is very odd, without a knowledge of the cause, to see their faces change so suddenly from earnestness to laughter; and odder still, to hear the rounds upon rounds of applause, rattling in the evening air, to which the curtain falls.',\n",
       "  'But, being Sunday night, they act their best and most attractive play.',\n",
       "  'And now, the sun is going down, in such magnificent array of red, and green, and golden light, as neither pen nor pencil could depict; and to the ringing of the vesper bells, darkness sets in at once, without a twilight.',\n",
       "  'Then, lights begin to shine in Genoa, and on the country road; and the revolving lantern out at sea there, flashing, for an instant, on this palace front and portico, illuminates it as if there were a bright moon bursting from behind a cloud; then, merges it in deep obscurity.',\n",
       "  'And this, so far as I know, is the only reason why the Genoese avoid it after dark, and think it haunted.',\n",
       "  'My memory will haunt it, many nights, in time to come; but nothing worse, I will engage.',\n",
       "  'The same Ghost \"will occasionally sail away, as I did one pleasant Autumn evening, into the bright prospect, and snuff the morning air at Marseilles.',\n",
       "  'The corpulent hair-dresser was still sitting in his slippers outside his shop-door there, but the twirling ladies in the window, with the natural inconstancy of their sex, had ceased to twirl, and were languishing, stock still, with their beautiful faces addressed to blind corners of the establishment, where it was impossible for admirers to penetrate.',\n",
       "  'The steamer had come from Genoa in a delicious run of eighteen hours, and we were going to run back again by the Cornice Road from Nice: not being satisfied to have seen only the outsides of the beautiful towns that rise in picturesque white clusters from among the olive woods, and rocks, and hills, upon the margin of the Sea.',\n",
       "  \"The Boat which started for Nice that night, at eight o ' clock, was very small, and so crowded with goods that there was scarcely room to move; neither was there anything to eat on board, except bread; nor to drink, except coffee.\",\n",
       "  'But being due at Nice at about eight or so in the morning, this was of no consequence: so when we began to wink at the bright stars, in involuntary acknowledgement of their winking at us, we turned into our berths, in a crowded, but cool little cabin, and slept soundly till morning.',\n",
       "  'The Boat, being as dull and dogged a little boat as ever was built, it was within an hour of noon when we turned into Nice Harbour, where we very little expected anything but breakfast.',\n",
       "  'But we were laden with wool.',\n",
       "  'Wool must not remain in the Custom House at Marseilles more than twelve months at a stretch, without paying duty.',\n",
       "  'It is the custom to make fictitious removals of unsold wool to evade this law; to take it somewhere when the twelve months are nearly out; bring it straight back again; and warehouse it, as a new cargo, for nearly twelve months longer.',\n",
       "  'This wool of ours, had come originally from some place in the East.',\n",
       "  'It was recognised as Eastern produce, the moment we entered the harbour.',\n",
       "  'Accordingly, the gay little Sunday boats, full of holiday people, which had come off to greet us, were warned away by the authorities; we were declared in quarantine; and a great flag was solemnly run up to the mast-head on the wharf, to make it known to all the town.',\n",
       "  'It was a very hot day indeed.',\n",
       "  \"We were unshaved, unwashed, undressed, unfed, and could hardly enjoy the absurdity of lying blistering in a lazy harbour, with the town looking on from a respectful distance, all manner of whiskered men in cocked hats discussing our fate at a remote guard-house, with gestures (we looked very hard at them through telescopes) expressive of a week ' s detention at least: and nothing whatever the matter all the time.\",\n",
       "  'But even in this crisis the Brave Courier achieved a triumph.',\n",
       "  'He telegraphed somebody (I saw nobody) either naturally connected with the hotel, or put en rapport with the establishment for that occasion only.',\n",
       "  'The telegraph was answered, and in half an hour or less, there came a loud shout from the guard-house.',\n",
       "  'The captain was wanted.',\n",
       "  'Everybody helped the captain into his boat.',\n",
       "  'Everybody got his luggage, and said we were going.',\n",
       "  \"The captain rowed away, and disappeared behind a little jutting corner of the Galley-slaves '  Prison: and presently came back with something, very sulkily.\",\n",
       "  'The Brave Courier met him at the side, and received the something as its rightful owner.',\n",
       "  'It was a wicker-basket, folded in a linen cloth; and in it were two great bottles of wine, a roast fowl, some salt fish chopped with garlic, a great loaf of bread, a dozen or so of peaches, and a few other trifles.',\n",
       "  'When we had selected our own breakfast, the Brave Courier invited a chosen party to partake of these refreshments, and assured them that they need not be deterred by motives of delicacy, as he would order a second basket to be furnished at their expense.',\n",
       "  'Which he did—no one knew how—and by and by, the captain being again summoned, again sulkily returned with another something; over which my popular attendant presided as before: carving with a clasp-knife, his own personal property, something smaller than a Roman sword.',\n",
       "  \"The whole party on board were made merry by these unexpected supplies; but none more so, than a loquacious little Frenchman, who got drunk in five minutes, and a sturdy Cappuccino Friar, who had taken everybody ' s fancy mightily, and was one of the best friars in the world, I verily believe.\",\n",
       "  'He had a free, open countenance; and a rich brown, flowing beard; and was a remarkably handsome man, of about fifty.',\n",
       "  'He had come up to us, early in the morning, and inquired whether we were sure to be at Nice by eleven; saying that he particularly wanted to know, because if we reached it by that time he would have to perform mass, and must deal with the consecrated wafer, fasting; whereas, if there were no chance of his being in time, he would immediately breakfast.',\n",

       "  'Quite lately Dr. Fritz Muller, who is prosecuting entomological research in the virgin forests of Brazil, stated that he was brought to consider as sexual organs for the diffusion of odours the various pencils, tufts and manes of hair, and the chalky, silky, or velvety spots of peculiar scales, as well as the recurved margin or other pouches enclosing pale buff or white down, which distinguish the wings of many of the brilliant exotic male butterflies.',\n",
       "  'And in a general way this assumption is by no means improbable ; for although instances occur where these insignia appear in the opposite sex in measure, and, as evolutionists would state it, acquired by the males, they have been transmitted in the lapse of time to their consorts, yet otherwise, in a majority of cases, they seem truly masculine.',\n",
       "  'In the Papilionidae, for instance, the front wings of the males have sometimes an oval chalky spot on their under side, opposite to which there is a dark brownish spot on the upper side of the hind wings, both spots emitting a strong disagreeable odour.',\n",
       "  'At other times, the scent spot on the fore wings is replaced by a brush of hair, and that on the hind wing is chalky and fragrant of musk, as may be seen in the common canary-coloured butterflies of the tropics, Callidryas.',\n",
       "  'Here likewise the females show on either side of their anal organs a shining spot odoriferous of a volatile acid.',\n",
       "  'A third example we may find in the male of our English Clouded Yellows, where the chalky spot is seen without the brush, the pot of rose-water without the sprinkler.',\n",
       "  \"In other genera certain “ plumules/ '  or club-shaped scales, fringed with fine hair, have been accused of possessing scent properties.\",\n",
       "  'Our small White Butterfly, belonging to one of these, has a male, according to Kirby, redolent of thyme, and with some of his exotic fraternity the scent is described by Dr. Muller as delicious; but in such cases a caution, as Professor Westwood has noticed, is doubtless needful, for may not these bright beings that bathe in sunlight and vapoury distillations the livelong day, gather odour as they fly about.',\n",
       "  'We have many moths, likewise, with raised scales on the wing-surface, but I am not aware this is the source of scent attraction.',\n",
       "  'Lastly, organs of perfume are said to exist in the sub-family of the Swallow Tails along the anal margin of the hind wings of the males, which is then recurved.',\n",
       "  'They are evinced by a tuft of hair with a disagreeable odour.',\n",
       "  \"In the Nymphalidae, or great group of butterflies with rudimentary forelegs, we find some of the common cosmopolitan Dana ' inse have dactylate hollow processes at the abdominal extremity, which are furnished with hairs, and on protrusion emit a disagreeable odour ; and sexual pouches, possibly in connection, exist on the first median nervure of the hind wing in a few species ; both being seen in the tawny Danais, that extends its range to Southern Europe.\",\n",
       "  'Others of the Ithonia group have a tuft of long hair near the anterior margin of the hind wings, sometimes common to the sexes, and flavouring of vanilla, while the males have a brown spot covered by the tuft.',\n",
       "  'The spot and brush of the Yellow Callidryas are reproduced in one of the Satyrinse, and in some of the Nymphalinse ; while in the male of the blue Ageronia Arethusa a rather strong odour is emitted by two large brown spots, situated between the wings, which appear absent in others of this musical genus.',\n",
       "  'The gdorious blue satin Morphos, the pride of Brazilian forest trees, have protrusible hemispherical anal appendages, which sometimes are odoriferous of vanilla ; and in the Brassolinse, another bulky South American progeny, pencils of erectile hairs or spots of scales are present.',\n",
       "  \"So, too, the peculiar long-winged ITeliconinse of the glades have scent organs in the male, situated between the anal valves, and in the female these are placed on the dorsal side of the abdominal extremity; but some have also a scent-brush, if conclusion may be drawn from a figure in the volume on “ Foreign Butterflies,” belonging to the Naturalist ' s Library series.\",\n",
       "  'But Didonis Biblis , according to Dr. Muller, is, so far as odours are concerned, the most interesting of all these fairy-formed and many-coloured things of the tropical bush.',\n",
       "  'On seizing one of these butterflies of either sex, it pushes from between the fourth and fifth segment of the abdomen two hemispherical protuberances producing a disagreeable odour; and the male has a second pair between the fifth and sixth segments of the abdomen, while a different musk-like odour is produced by a black spot beneath the front wings.',\n",
       "  'In the tailed Hair Streaks the sexual spot that may be seen on the disc of the front wings of the female of our green sort, is said to be odorous; and if so, this is a singular instance of a scent secretion supplanting a fixed wing colour.',\n",
       "  'The Skipper Butterflies, diurnal over our northern hills and woodland, amid the scorching tropical glare are known as evening visitors, stealing mysteriously to hang at the garden lupins in purple dusk, before a reflex light has awoke a second  and chaotic dawn.',\n",
       "  'They neither in colour as a rule bear the burnish and talismanic impress of the sunlight, or in form do they attain the feathery etherealness of the day fliers; their antennae and various organs seem fairly heavy and moth-like, and moth-like also are the expansile scent pencils of hair that garnish the hind tibiae of the legs of many of the males.',\n",
       "  'Passing to the Burnet kind, a like incarnation of the union of night and day, the males of exotic Glaucopidae have two long retractable filaments, generally beset with hairs, on the ventral side of the abdomen, sometimes emitting a strong odour.',\n",
       "  'Bristling scent pencils, however, are most characteristic of the moths, and these usually distinguish the males, although, being commonly retained in their pouches, their presence is little suspected until they have been pricked out with a needle-point ; but in the twilight Sphinges, especially quick of nerve, they are sometimes found present in both sexes, and sharp fear, as we touch or grasp the ilower-hoverer reposing in diurnal lethargy, will cause their momentary expansion.',\n",
       "  \"Thus when the male Death ' s-Head Moth is on the point of Squeaking in our fingers, as its abdomen inflates, a sessile pencil of yellow hair starts from a fold between the dorsal and ventral arcs at the base (Plate V., Fig.\",\n",

       "  'This fluid aroma, secreted near the insertion of the “ fans,\" and traversing by capillary attraction to their extremity, stains them bright orange at the glands, shaded into yellow at their tip.',\n",
       "  'Similar “fans\" in the Convolvulus Hawk convey the sensation of amber or musk, and their anatomy has been investigated by Prof. Targioni, who describes the hyperdomal tissue opposite the insertion of the “ fans \" as composed of hexagonally nucleated pyriform cells, from each of which proceeds a tube to the base of the several hairs of the fascicle, which are inserted by means of a process; so that the unicellular glandules secrete the odoriferous matter, and the hairs become their excretory ducts.',\n",

       "  'We saw several fruits preserved in sugar, that we did not see recent from the tree, one of which is called Kimkit, and another Boa Atap: and here are several others which are eaten only by the natives, particularly the Kellor, the Guilindina, the Moringa, and the Soccum.',\n",
       "  'The Soccum is of the same kind with the bread-fruit in the South Sea islands, but so much inferior, that if it had not been for the similitude in the outward appearance both of the fruit and the tree, we should not have referred it to that class.',\n",

       "  'The days however on which these markets are held are ill contrived; the time between Saturday and Monday is too short, and that between Monday and Saturday too long: great part of what is bought on Monday is always much the worse for keeping before a new stock can be bought, either by the retailer or consumer; so that for several days in every week there is no good fruit in the hands of any people but the Chinese in Passar Pissang.',\n",

       "  'Abundance of perfumes and preparations were prescribed by physicians, some of one kind and some of another, in which the people who listened to them put themselves to a great, and indeed, in my opinion, to an unnecessary expense; and the poorer people, who only set open their windows night and day, burned brimstone, pitch, and gunpowder, and such things in their rooms, did as well as the best; nay, the eager people who, as I said above, came home in haste and at all hazards, found little or no inconvenience in their houses, nor in the goods, and did little or nothing to them.',\n",
       "  'However, in general, prudent, cautious people did enter into some measures for airing and sweetening their houses, and burned perfumes, incense, benjamin, rozin, and sulphur in their rooms close shut up, and then let the air carry it all out with a blast of gunpowder; others caused large fires to be made all day and all night for several days and nights; by the same token that two or three were pleased to set their houses on fire, and so effectually sweetened them by burning them down to the ground; as particularly one at Ratcliff, one in Holbourn, and one at Westminster; besides two or three that were set on fire, but the fire was happily got out again before it went far enough to burn down the houses; and one citizen’s servant, I think it was in Thames Street, carried so much gunpowder into his master’s house, for clearing it of the infection, and managed it so foolishly, that he blew up part of the roof of the house.',\n",
       "  'But the time was not fully come that the city was to be purged by fire, nor was it far off; for within nine months more I saw it all lying in ashes; when, as some of our quacking philosophers pretend, the seeds of the plague were entirely destroyed, and not before; a notion too ridiculous to speak of here: since, had the seeds of the plague remained in the houses, not to be destroyed but by fire, how has it been that they have not since broken out, seeing all those buildings in the suburbs and liberties, all in the great parishes of Stepney, Whitechappel, Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Cripplegate, and St Giles, where the fire never came, and where the plague raged with the greatest violence, remain still in the same condition they were in before?',\n",
       "  'But to leave these things just as I found them, it was certain that those people who were more than ordinarily cautious of their health, did take particular directions for what they called seasoning of their houses, and abundance of costly things were consumed on that account which I cannot but say not only seasoned those houses, as they desired, but filled the air with very grateful and wholesome smells which others had the share of the benefit of as well as those who were at the expenses of them.',\n",

       "  'Every sensible day-labourer hath as clear a notion of this, and as full a conviction of the possibility of it, as he hath of his own existence; and can no more doubt of the one than of the other.',\n",

       "  'I believe there is not much more wisdom in many of those paradoxes of the ideal philosophy, which to plain sensible men appear to be palpable absurdities, but with the adepts pass for profound discoveries.',\n",
       "  'I resolve, for my own part, always to pay a great regard to the dictates of common sense, and not to depart from them without absolute necessity; and therefore I am apt to think, that there is really something in the rose or lily, which is by the vulgar called smell, and which continues to exist when it is not smelled: and shall proceed to inquire what this is; how we come by the notion of it; and what relation this quality or virtue of smell hath to the sensation, which we have been obliged to call by the same name, for want of another.',\n",
       "  'Let us therefore suppose, as before, a person to exercise the sense of smelling: a little experience will discover to him, that the nose is the organ of this sense, and that the air, or something in the air, is a medium of it.',\n",

       "  'But here it deserves our notice, that although the sensation may seem more closely related to the mind its subject, or to the nose its organ; yet neither of these connections operate so powerfully upon the imagination, as its connection with the rose its concomitant.',\n",
       "  'The reason of this seems to be, that its connection with the mind is more general, and no way distinguisheth it from other smells, or even from tastes, sounds, and other kinds of sensations.',\n",
       "  'The relation it hath to the organ, is likewise general, and doth not distinguish it from other smells; but the connection it hath with the rose is special, and constant: by which means they become almost inseparable in the imagination; in like manner as thunder and lightning, freezing and cold.',\n",

       "  'The smell of a rose is a certain aff ection or feeling of the mind; and as it is not constant, but comes and goes, we want to know when and where we may expect it, and are uneasy till we find something, which being present, brings this feeling along with it, and being removed, removes it.',\n",
       "  'This, when found, we call the cause of it; not a strict and philosophical sense, as if the feeling were really effected or produced by that cause, but in a popular sense: for the mind is satisfied, if there is a constant conjunction between them; and such causes are in reality nothing else but laws of nature.',\n",
